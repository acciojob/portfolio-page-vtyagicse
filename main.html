			Hard skills are usually teachable while soft skills are typically
			personality traits that are much harder to develop and therefore 
			extremely valuable to employers. In most cases, your soft skills 
			can enhance your hard skills. For example, if you’re a detail-oriented
			software developer skilled in a computer programming language, you’ll 
			likely be able to catch errors and correct issues in the code you and your
			team create.
